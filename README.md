# Collaborations
Here you can find some informations about the projects I would like to carry out, or that I've carried out, in collaboration with someone outside my workplace and outside my academic network. Typically I try to work on one or two projects each year with some data enthusiast like me. Most of this projects are either reviews on specific topics, challenges, exchange of opinions and collaborative coding. If you are interested contact me by on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-lavagna-0675a81a2/) or by e-mail llavagna@proton.me.
